# pak-tour-agency


## Project Overview

Pak Tour Agency is a travel management web application that provides users with a platform to explore various tours, make bookings, and search for tours based on different criteria such as location, price, and tour title. The project is implemented with **Laravel** as the backend framework and uses **AJAX** to provide dynamic search functionality. The system allows for CRUD operations, user management, and interaction through APIs to manage tour-related data.

## Project Features

- **CRUD Implementation**:  
  - **Create**: Users can create new tours via the admin panel.
  - **Read**: Users can view available tours with filtering capabilities.
  - **Update**: Admins can update tour details.
  - **Delete**: Admins can delete existing tours.
  
- **Relationship Implementation**:  
  - Tours are related to bookings, ensuring that users can book specific tours.

- **AJAX Integration**:  
  - Dynamic search functionality is implemented using AJAX for searching tours without reloading the page.

- **API Implementation**:  
  - Exposes data for tour listing, search, and booking through a dedicated API for external access.

- **User Interaction**:  
  Users can browse the available tours, use the search functionality to filter results by tour name, description, or price, and book a tour.

- **AJAX Search**:  
  The search bar uses AJAX to dynamically filter the tours based on user input without requiring page reloads.
